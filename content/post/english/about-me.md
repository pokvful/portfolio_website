My name is Tim, I am a motivated and passionate developer from The Netherlands. 

I have always liked tech since the age of 9. 

I started my journey in IT in Network Administration, after getting my degree I got the idea of getting into programming. 

The main motivator for this choice was because I was curious about how software was actually being made and I was looking for a new challenge. 

Since then I have been on my journey for my Bachelor degree in Computing Science at the HAN in Arnhem. 

Right now I am in my third schoolyear and learning every day. 

My current passion lies in learning the programming language Rust; and building OO-applications with help of Java.
