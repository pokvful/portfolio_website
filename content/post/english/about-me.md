My name is Tim, I am a motivated and passionate developer from The Netherlands. 

I started my journey in IT in Network Administration, after getting my degree I got the idea of getting into programming. 

The main motivator for this choice was because I was curious about how software was actually being made and I was looking for a new challenge.

My current passion lies in learning the programming language Rust; and building OO-applications with help of Java.
